# 🏙️ London Housing Market & Crime Analysis (2000–2023)

## 🔍 Overview
This project explores the intersection of housing prices and crime levels across London's boroughs using government datasets. It aims to uncover how crime trends relate to property values and identify borough-level insights for investors, policy makers, and city planners.

## 📊 Data Sources
- [UK House Price Index (HPI)](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/house-price-index-statistical-data)
- [London Borough-Level Crime Data](https://data.police.uk/data/)

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze average house prices across all London boroughs
- Compare trends in housing affordability and crime levels
- Visualize patterns to identify high-growth, low-crime zones
- Explore relationships between property trends and public safety

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- **Python**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Data Cleaning**: Duplicate/null removal, renaming columns
- **Visualization**: Time series plots, heatmaps, comparative bar graphs

## 🧪 Key Steps
### ✅ Data Cleaning
- Renamed unnamed columns for consistency
- Removed irrelevant and null data
- Converted categorical values to numeric types
- Filtered London-specific boroughs

### 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis
- Borough-wise average house price trends (2000–2023)
- Year-over-year growth % analysis
- Borough crime count distribution
- Comparison of crime levels vs property values

## 📈 Visualizations
- Line plots of house prices by borough
- Heatmaps: Crime count vs. property value
- Bar chart: Top 10 boroughs by growth & crime rate
- Correlation plots of socio-economic indicators

## 💡 Insights
- Central boroughs (e.g., Westminster, Kensington) show high property value but also high crime
- Some outer boroughs (e.g., Bexley, Sutton) show moderate pricing with low crime — ideal for long-term investment
- Post-2016, most boroughs experienced a slowdown in price growth
